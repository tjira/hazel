# Quantum Hazel

Quantum Hazel is a quantum mechanical software packaged in a single executable. Similarly as other quantum programs you pass an input file to the executable. The output will be printed into the terminal. This page serves as a documentation to the software. Here you will find examples, usage and explanation of quantum mechanical methods used in the code. The theory here will be from the computational perspective and detailed derivations will not be given here.
