## ‚ú® Features

Below are all the important features of Hazel divided into categories.

### Quantum Mechanical Methods

* M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset Perturbation Theory
* Full Configuration Interaction

### Additional Calculations

* Gradients, Hessians and Frequency Analysis
* Steepest Descent Optimization

* Exact Quantum Dyamics
* Molecular Dynamics

### Convergence Accelerators

* Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

### The Simple Way

The easiest cross-platform way to compile Hazel is using CMake with the following command.

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGOMP=ON -DSTANDALONE=ON .
```

If the configuration finished without errors, compile the project by running the following command.

```bash
cmake --build build
```

After the compilation the bin folder will be created along with the executable. Keep in mind that this way some of the features might be missing.

### The Proper Way

The proper way is only available on Linux. The software requires the [libint](https://github.com/evaleev/libint) library. Before the library compilation process, make sure you have [eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen), [boost](https://github.com/boostorg/boost) an some basic X libraries installed. On debian-based distributions, you can do it with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxrandr-dev
```

To compile the library execute `./script/libint.sh` from the project root directory. This command creates the *libint* folder with the compiled library. Now, we export the necessary environment variables.

```bash
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$PWD/libint/install/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/libint/install/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"
```

After this, the project configuration should finish without errors.

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGOMP=ON .
```

And we can build with the following command.

```bash
cmake --build build
```

After the compilation the bin folder will be created along with the executable.

## üñ•Ô∏è Examples

This section show some basic calculation examples. You can view all the options of a specific command directly from the software by executing the calculation with added `-h` flag.

### Integral Calculation

This example calculates only the molecular integrals. To view or export them add the options from the following section to the `-p` (print) or `-e` (export) flag.

```bash
hazel -f molecule.xyz -b sto-3g ints
```

### Restricted Hartree-Fock Method

Basic HF calculation with no extra options. You can view all the options by adding the `-h` flag.

```bash
hazel -f molecule.xyz -b sto-3g rhf
```

### Post Hartree-Fock Methods

To execute some implemented post HF method add the corresponding keyword after the `rhf` keyword. To view available post HF methods add the `-h` flag after the `rhf` keyword. The example below shows the MP2 calculation.

```bash
hazel -f molecule.xyz -b sto-3g rhf mp2
```

### Quantum Gradients and Frequencies

Currently, the HF method is the only one with implemented analytical gradient. To calculate it execute the following command.

```bash
hazel -f molecule.xyz -b sto-3g rhf -g 0 1e-5
```

The 0 disables numerical gradient and 1e-5 is the step size for numerical gradient. The step is not ussed for analytical gradient, but you have to specify it if you plan to add another options after the `-g` flag. You can calculate numerical gradients with the post HF methods as follows.

```bash
hazel -f molecule.xyz -b sto-3g rhf fci -g 1 1e-5
```

The 1 enables numerical gradient and 1e-5 is the step size. The frequencies have to be calculated numerically. Below is an example to calculate it for the MP2 method.

```bash
hazel -f molecule.xyz -b sto-3g rhf mp2 -f 1 1e-5
```

### Molecular Optimization

To optimize a molecule using RHF method you can do the following. 

```bash
hazel -f molecule.xyz -b sto-3g opt -t 1e-8 rhf -g 1 1e-5
```

We also specified options for the gradient calculation. The 1e-8 is the gradient threshold for optimization.

### Molecular Dynamics

To perform simple MP2 molecular dynamics with default settings for the gradient execute the following.

```bash
hazel -f molecule.xyz -b sto-3g md rhf mp2
```

During the calculation the file trajectory.xyz will be created.
