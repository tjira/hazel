<p align="center">
Hazel is a collection of various electronic structure methods. It works similarly to the other available quantum programs. It is provided with a geometry file, the calculation is specified int the command line and results are printed to the terminal.

## ‚ú® Features

Below are all the important features of Hazel divided into categories.

### Quantum Mechanical Methods

* Hartree-Fock Method (RHF & UHF)
* M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset Perturbation Theory
* Full Configuration Interaction

### Convergence Accelerators

* Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace

### Additional Calculations

* Numerical Hessians and Frequency Analysis for HF and MP2
* Gradients for HF (Analytical) and MP2 (Numerical)
* HF and RMP2 Steepest Descent Optimization
* Potential Energy Surface Scan
* Exact Quantum Dyamics
* Molecular Dynamics

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation

### The Simple Way

The easiest cross-platform way to compile Hazel is using CMake with the following command.

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGOMP=ON -DSTANDALONE=ON .
```

If the configuration finished without errors, compile the project by running the following command.

```bash
cmake --build build
```

After the compilation the bin folder will be created along with the executable. Keep in mind that this way some of the features might be missing.

### The Proper Way

The proper way is only available on Linux. The software requires the [libint](https://github.com/evaleev/libint) library. Before the library compilation process, make sure you have [eigen](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) and [boost](https://github.com/boostorg/boost) installed. On debian-based distributions, you can do it with the following command.

```bash
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev
```

To compile the library execute `./script/libint.sh` from the project root directory. This command creates the *libint* folder with the compiled library. Now, we export the necessary environment variables.

```bash
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$PWD/libint/install/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
export LIBRARY_PATH="$PWD/libint/install/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH"
```

After this, the project configuration should finish without errors.

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DGOMP=ON .
```

And we can build with the following command.

```bash
cmake --build build
```

After the compilation the bin folder will be created along with the executable.
